					<h1> About </h1>
				
					<p>    Our Story: In-Tune records was founded in 2022 to provide a home for the lesser known and hard-to-find music you love. We began with a passion for music which we hope to share with you. Our specialty lies in EDM such as UK Hardcore and Touhou Eurobeat. We began growing our collection, and now we're confident that we'll have something our customers are looking for. </p>
