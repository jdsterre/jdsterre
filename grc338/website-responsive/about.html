                <p>In-Tune records was founded in 2022 to provide a home for the lesser known and hard-to-find music you love. We began with a passion for music which we hope to share with you. We've continued to grow our collection, and now we're confident that we'll have something our customers are looking for. Our specialty lies in EDM such as UK Hardcore and Touhou Eurobeat, though we're happy to find whatever you're looking for..</p>
