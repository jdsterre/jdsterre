        <h1>Interstate vs. DIN </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Interstate</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Designed by Tobias Frere-Jones in 1993, Interstate is a sans-serif typeface inspired by the typography found on American highway signs. Its name references the vast network of interstates across the United States. Frere-Jones crafted Interstate to capture the essence of American transportation systems, combining geometric precision with a sense of dynamism. The typeface's sturdy letterforms and generous spacing were optimized for readability at high speeds and in different weather conditions. Interstate's creation coincided with a resurgence of interest in minimalist and industrial design aesthetics in the early 1990s, making it a fitting choice for graphic designers seeking a more contemporary typeface. Since its creation, Interstate has become synonymous with efficiency, clarity, and forward momentum.</p>
             
			 <h3>DIN</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Designed by Albert-Jan Pool in 1995, DIN is a sans-serif typeface originally created for the German public sector, particularly for road and traffic signage. The name "DIN" stands for "Deutsche Industrie-Norm," reflecting its adherence to the standards set by the German Institute for Standardization. Its clean, geometric forms and uniform stroke widths were specifically crafted for optimal legibility at various distances and angles, making it ideal for wayfinding systems. DIN's origins can be traced back to the early 20th century when the German government sought to standardize typography for official documents and public communication. Pool's revival of the typeface in the 1990s popularized it for a wide range of applications beyond its original intended use.</p>
